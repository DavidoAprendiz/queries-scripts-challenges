> 2. This program only stores the "Miner Results" in a local folder as **MinerResults.json** and the **WhatToMine.json**
> 3. Do not change the folder/directory structure or will break something.
> 4. The output currency is equal to Dollars ($), if Internet is available (powered by TokenJay.App and WhatToMine.com).
>    1. Otherwise, the currency is equal to the inserted currency (â‚¬/$).
> 5. Check in the docs folder for the latest 'how to' video.
> 6. This calculator allows to calculate any coin, but Ergo :)
